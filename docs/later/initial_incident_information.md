## Prediction tool idea

By working closely with the organisations that handle response calls we can provide a prediction tool based on the call details, so that the crew can have an idea of the possible issues before arriving at the scene. This will allow for more additional information that the caller may not be able to provide. 
## Information received when someone calls in:

EMERGENCY CALL-OUT PROCEDURE

1. NAME
2. TELEPHONE NUMBER
3. LOCATION
4. DETAILS OF VESSEL OR INCIDENT
5. NUMBER OF PERSONS INVOLVED

- [ ] What systems are in place for this information to be relayed to LLRB crew?
- [ ] How can we provide the crew with the most information possible to make informed decisions quickly.
