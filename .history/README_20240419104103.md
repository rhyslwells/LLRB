## Project Overview

The [Loch Lomond Rescue Boat](https://www.lochlomondrescueboat.org/) (LLRB) is a charitable service protecting the waters of Loch Lomond. 

To optimize their operations and enhance public safety, we focus on three key ares: preparedness, prediction, and public awareness.

## Preparedness

**Goals**:
- Communicate with LLRB to discover requirements , and motivate data recording techniques to allow for future analysis.
- Provide regular insightful reporting. One method could be to analyse incidents by dates/seasons and forecast future possible incidents and suggest strategies/training for handling those.
- Use insights to inform training, preparedness efforts, and facilitate collaborative initiatives with other agencies.

## Prediction

**Goals:**
- Provide an interactable/filterable map that marks historical areas of given incidents.
- Provide a prediction tool for targets such as location and length of callout time.

## Public Awareness

**Goals:**
- Utilise social media metrics to schedule impactful posts to increase public engagement.
- Implement templates to streamline content distribution and ensure effective communication with the audience.
