# Outline

1) We started with combined.csv then in datatime.ipynb we standardise the dates and times to a common format and save as preprocessed_dates_time_data.csv.

2) In preprocessing.ipynb

we format crew,location and pager-code features. We add additional features to parse out these details.

3) In analysis.ipynb we provide graphs for report.md.

Notes:


# Next steps:
- [ ] Complete report.md

Later:
- [ ] Contact those on the social media side and what could benifit them.
- [ ] Make make interactable with java - see possibly geojson,  Leaflet.js. Generalise to realtime with Kafka? 
- [ ] In data/for_parsing we have incident descriptions with dates. We can parse these and add shout-detail-tags.

Done:
- [X] Manually add remaining tags from shout details.
