# Overview

This report is a summary of the data collected by Loch Lomond Rescue Boat (LLRB) from 2021 to 2023. We provide insights into the incidents, crew attendance and training, discuss ways to improve social media posts, give suggestions on improving the data collection process, and suggest further lines of enquiry.

# Background and Data exploration

After ever incident the crew at Loch Lomond Rescue Boat (LLRB) record the details of the incident. In this report we:

- explore the data collected by LLRB from 2021 to 2023,
- provide insights into the incidents, crew attendance and training,
- discuss ways to improve social media posts,
- give suggestions on improving the data collection process,
- and suggest further lines of enquiry.

# Incident analysis

First we look at the distrubutions on indicents by month per year.

INSERT: docs\imgs\monthly_pagers.png

Insights:

- August 2021 has few entries as data collection begun then.
- We can see that there is a peak in May,June and July which coinides with the summer months.
- Proportionatley there are more 999 calls outside of the summer months.

Questions:
- Why is there an uptick in 999 call in Feburary 2023? 
- What is the reason for the uptick  in 222 calls in 2023?


#  Time analysis 

docs\imgs\dist_shout_launch.png

See that shout to launch for each code we have a median of 15mins

docs\imgs\dist_lauch_return.png

docs\imgs\dist_shout_return.png

See that launch to return 222 are resolved on average faster than 333 and 999. Additionally 333 and 99 have roughly the same time to return.

docs\imgs\scatter_shout_return.png

Insights:
- We see that alot of 999 happen between 12am-2am.
- Uptick around 1500-2100.
- Maximum time for non-outliers is around 250 mins (~4hrs).

Notes:
We have outliers (which we removed from this analysi) because the crew recorded a train exercise and an incident at the same time. It would have been better to note when the training finished or the incident started and log these as two separate events. Additionally the time of launch is before the time of shout - similary for the other outliers. We are working under the assumption that the time of shout precedes the time of boat launch. We now look at the boxplots for the time differences for the pager codes 222,333,999.



# shout tags

For each shout_detail item we provide shout_details_tags as a way to quickly understand the incident. Here are the tags and details they correspond to:

Tag categories:
- Mechanical
- Rescue
- Medical
- Environmental
- Mishap
- Assistance
- FalseAlarm
- Miscellaneous
- Search
- Transport

With the following graphs we can forecast the type incidents most likely to occur in a given month.

docs\imgs\tag_222.png

Insights:
- 999 are mostly Rescue>Medical>Mechanical
- 333 are mostly Mechanical>Rescue>Medical>Search
- 222 are mosly Mechanical>Assistance>Medical

We also note the take taken from shout to return for each tag.

# Crew Analysis 

Question do some members only attend at certain times? We ignore those with less than 5 incients attended.

docs\imgs\board_box.png

docs\imgs\shore_box.png

Some people have not atteneded any incidents. The following crew have not been on aboard for any incidents:

['GD', 'CC', 'JB', 'VM', 'JM', 'AC', 'FN', 'CA', 'TAM', 'GERARD', 'DAVY', 'LEE']

The following crew have not been on shore for any incidents:

['IG', 'AJM', 'CMS', 'EM', 'KM', 'VM', 'JM', 'AC', 'FN', 'FR', 'CA', 'CS', 'JT', 'TAM', 'GERARD', 'DAVY', 'LEE']

How many incidents has each crew memember attended and how are these incidents decomposed by pager code? We label coxswains with a (*) and safety advisors with a (+).

docs\imgs\board_reg.png

docs\imgs\board_occ.png

Insights:
- on board most attenders RB,ABJ, AM,DS,TR,RO,ABS.

docs\imgs\shore_reg.png

docs\imgs\shore_occ.png

In order to reduce the risk of being without experienced memebers. How can we ensure training is being passed on to the next generation, who would be the best candidates to train next?

Current Coxswains
1. Ronnie Britton - Coxswain 
2. Rennie Oliver - Deputy Coxswain 
3. Iain Gollan (Goz) - Deputy Coxswain 
4. Ally McLeod - Deputy Coxswain 
5. Andy Biddulph Snr - Deputy Coxswain & Safety Advisor 

From boad_reg figure who would be best to train as a coxswain? Who has the most activity and is able, but is not a coxswain?

Current safty advisors:
1. Andy Biddulph Snr
2. David O'Neil

## Training

Only two training shouts have been recorded. It would be good to have more training data to understand the training process. Particularly what is invovled and how often it is done and who needs training in certain areas.

Sometimes the crew record a training session and an incident at the same time. It would be better to note when the training finished or the incident started and log these as two separate events.

# Geolocation on map

We have attached a html of the incidents plotted on a map. Note to enhance the accuracy of recorded position data, we suggest that the crew record more precisely the position data by using What3Words or 
typing in google map coordinates.

INSERT: docs\imgs\map.html

# Social media and prevention

Craig Clancy and Callum MacKenzie Stevens oversee the social media side. To increase outreach, we propose the following:

- Incorporate more videos showcasing the conditions of the loch, from boat launching to return, boat cleaning,storing, and the collaborative efforts of emergency services.
- Highlight safety tips in post (such as with paddleboarding) related to common incidents like injuries along the West Highland Way or boat breakdowns due to weather conditions. These could be created ahead of time.
- Engage with the audience and hear their experiences and suggestions, in order to foster a sense of community and shared responsibility.

From past posts we could analyse the impacts of each and see how they are received, and provide feedback to the crew. By implementing these suggestions and monitoring their effectiveness, we can to optimise the social media presence for greater engagement and thereby preventing issues from arising in the the first place.

# Suggestions for data collection

To make it easier for crew we can have them input the What3Words for the incident location, or if they prefer the coordinates. To accomondate for this we have set up a tool that uses the What3Words API to convert the What3Words to coordinates. 

Should record time_of_shout_completion to counter time_of_shout, as may be different from time_boat_returned.

Try to specific a time for feats=['time_of_shout','time_boat_launched','time_boat_returned]

We recommend that the crew on board and on shore are recorded as initials, and as a comma separated list. If there are no crew on board or on shore, record as "None". This will make it easier to search for crew members and understand who was on board for each shout.

See data_recording.md



Only two training shouts have been recorded. It would be good to have more training data to understand the training process. Particularly what is invovled and how often it is done and who needs training in certain areas.

Add the following to the top of the document that records the data of incidents:

Data recording for crew:

For where they record the data, place an initial outline at the top left of the document outlining the following:
- For location spell names correctly
- For times use the format (15:20)
- For location use What3Words
- For crew recording use initials
- For shout_detail_tags based on shout_details use the following tags:
  - Mechanical
  - Rescue
  - Medical
  - Environmental

# Further lines of enquiry

Reading through the shout-details we see that LLRB also work with the following organisations:SAS,LLTNP,DMMS. How much interaction/cross organisational training and data sharing is there?

Question: What are the additionaly pager codes e.g. for 9992167 what does 2167 mean?

pager_code
222                                                                                                                     [ 4380]

999    [2167,  0210,  1682, 1701, 4432,  1324, 2804,  1977,  3665,  2784,  1448,  1919,  1087,  1573,  2788,  2465, 2336, 3743]
