## Data exploration

## shout tags

For each shout_detail item we provide shout_details_tags as a way to quickly understand the incident. Here are the tags and details they correspond to:

Tag categories:
- Mechanical
- Rescue
- Medical
- Environmental
- Mishap
- Assistance
- FalseAlarm
- Miscellaneous
- Search
- Transport

Reading through the shout-details we see that LLRB also work with the following organisations:
- SAS
- LLTNP
- DMMS
We will enquire about cross organisational training and data sharing.



## pager-codes

Question: What are the additionaly pager codes e.g. for 9992167 what does 2167 mean?

pager_code
222                                                                                                                     [ 4380]
333                    [ 2265, 369,  2428,  3077,  2673, 1753, 2585,  1846, 2563,  3072,  1151,  1456,  3439, 4906, 3630, 1717]
999    [2167,  0210,  1682, 1701, 4432,  1324, 2804,  1977,  3665,  2784,  1448,  1919,  1087,  1573,  2788,  2465, 2336, 3743]

Only two training shouts have been recorded. It would be good to have more training data to understand the training process. Particularly what is invovled and how often it is done and who needs training in certain areas.

## Suggestions for data collection

To make it easier for crew we can have them input the What3Words for the incident location, or if they prefer the coordinates. To accomondate for this we have set up a tool that uses the What3Words API to convert the What3Words to coordinates. 

Should record time_of_shout_completion to counter time_of_shout, as may be different from time_boat_returned.

Try to specific a time for feats=['time_of_shout','time_boat_launched','time_boat_returned]

See data_recording.md

## Collaboration

Would members of the LLRB be interested in collaborating with us on this project?

What organisations are involved with the LLRB, and can we use their resources.
