# Report

# Background and Data exploration

Why am I doing this.


# Incident analysis

 incidents per year by pager codes( what do we see)

- ensure consistent y-scales for each year - 25

year 2021 Q3 low because thats when data startted getting recorded.

2022 and 2023 low Q1 + Q4 because less people on loch at time.

why the uptick in 999 in Q1 2023? 

Massive uptick Q2 2022 to 2023.

#  times 

shout to launch medians all 15mins

launch to return 222 are resolved on average faster that 333 and 999. 

INSERT boxplots



# shout tags

For each shout_detail item we provide shout_details_tags as a way to quickly understand the incident. Here are the tags and details they correspond to:

Tag categories:
- Mechanical
- Rescue
- Medical
- Environmental
- Mishap
- Assistance
- FalseAlarm
- Miscellaneous
- Search
- Transport

INSERT diagram of shout-tags pie charts? per year

Reading through the shout-details we see that LLRB also work with the following organisations:
- SAS
- LLTNP
- DMMS
We will enquire about cross organisational training and data sharing.


# Geolocation on map


# Social media

Of the social media posts there are only a handful of recordings it may be interesting for people to see the conditions of the loch and the boat launching and returning.

Take more videos.

media videos of the condiitions of the loch, people runing to the boat, the boat launching, the boat returning, the boat being cleaned, the boat being stored.
emergency services working together.

Recently there was apost about paddle boarding with advice.
If an incident falls within a area which often occurs it may be worth posting about it with advice slide.

Examples: 
- West highland way injuries
- Boat breakdowns
- Weather conditions


# Crew Analysis 

Table of initials and name of crew members.

INSERT diagrams.

For crew_on_board why have [---] been on no incidents ?

For crew_on_shore why have [---] been on no incidents ?

on board attenders the most.
RB,ABJ, AM,DS,TR,RO,ABS.

on shore 

Who would be best to train next - experience

Who goes to the most call outs.

Who is not a coxswain already.

# Suggestions for data collection

To make it easier for crew we can have them input the What3Words for the incident location, or if they prefer the coordinates. To accomondate for this we have set up a tool that uses the What3Words API to convert the What3Words to coordinates. 

Should record time_of_shout_completion to counter time_of_shout, as may be different from time_boat_returned.

Try to specific a time for feats=['time_of_shout','time_boat_launched','time_boat_returned]

We recommend that the crew on board and on shore are recorded as initials, and as a comma separated list. If there are no crew on board or on shore, record as "None". This will make it easier to search for crew members and understand who was on board for each shout.

Question: What are the additionaly pager codes e.g. for 9992167 what does 2167 mean?

pager_code
222                                                                                                                     [ 4380]
333                    [ 2265, 369,  2428,  3077,  2673, 1753, 2585,  1846, 2563,  3072,  1151,  1456,  3439, 4906, 3630, 1717]
999    [2167,  0210,  1682, 1701, 4432,  1324, 2804,  1977,  3665,  2784,  1448,  1919,  1087,  1573,  2788,  2465, 2336, 3743]

Only two training shouts have been recorded. It would be good to have more training data to understand the training process. Particularly what is invovled and how often it is done and who needs training in certain areas.
