# Background and Data exploration

After ever incident the crew at Loch Lomond Rescue Boat (LLRB) record the details of the incident. In this report we:

- explore the data collected by LLRB from 2021 to 2023,
- provide insights into the incidents, crew attendance and training,
- discuss ways to improve social media posts,
- give suggestions on improving the data collection process,
- and suggest further lines of enquiry.

2021-08-04 to 2023-09-12

# Incident analysis

First we look at the distrubutions on indicents by month per year.

INSERT: docs\imgs\monthly_pagers.png

Insights:

- August 2021 has few entries as data collection begun then.
- We can see that there is a peak in May,June and July which coinides with the summer months.
- Proportionatley there are more 999 calls outside of the summer months.

Questions:
- Why is there an uptick in 999 call in Feburary 2023? 
- What is the reason for the uptick  in 222 calls in 2023?


#  Time analysis 

docs\imgs\dist_shout_launch.png

See that shout to launch for each code we have a median of 15mins

docs\imgs\dist_lauch_return.png

docs\imgs\dist_shout_return.png

See that launch to return 222 are resolved on average faster than 333 and 999. Additionally 333 and 99 have roughly the same time to return.

docs\imgs\scatter_shout_return.png

Insights:
- We see that alot of 999 happen between 12am-2am.
- Uptick around 1500-2100.
- Maximum time for non-outliers is around 250 mins (~4hrs).

Notes:
We have outliers (which we removed from this analysi) because the crew recorded a train exercise and an incident at the same time. It would have been better to note when the training finished or the incident started and log these as two separate events. Additionally the time of launch is before the time of shout - similary for the other outliers. We are working under the assumption that the time of shout precedes the time of boat launch. We now look at the boxplots for the time differences for the pager codes 222,333,999.



# shout tags

For each shout_detail item we provide shout_details_tags as a way to quickly understand the incident. Here are the tags and details they correspond to:

Tag categories:
- Mechanical
- Rescue
- Medical
- Environmental
- Mishap
- Assistance
- FalseAlarm
- Miscellaneous
- Search
- Transport

With the following graphs we can forecast the type incidents most likely to occur in a given month.


INSERT diagram of shout-tags per month per year

docs\imgs\tag_999.png

docs\imgs\tag_333.png

docs\imgs\tag_222.png

Insights:
- 999 are mostly Rescue>Medical>Mechanical
- 333 are mostly Mechanical>Rescue>Medical>Search
- 222 are mosly Mechanical>Assistance>Medical

We also note the take taken from shout to return for each tag.

# Crew Analysis 

Question do some members only attend at certain times? WE ignore those with less than 5 incients attended.

docs\imgs\board_box.png

docs\imgs\shore_box.png

How many incidents has each crew memember attended and how are these incidents decomposed by pager code?

The following crew have not been on aboard for any incidents:

['GD', 'CC', 'JB', 'VM', 'JM', 'AC', 'FN', 'CA', 'TAM', 'GERARD', 'DAVY', 'LEE']

The following crew have not been on shore for any incidents:

['IG', 'AJM', 'CMS', 'EM', 'KM', 'VM', 'JM', 'AC', 'FN', 'FR', 'CA', 'CS', 'JT', 'TAM', 'GERARD', 'DAVY', 'LEE']













## Training

In order to reduce the risk of being without experienced memebers. How can we ensure training is being passed on to the next generation, who would be the best candidates to train next?


Table of initials and name of crew members.

INSERT diagrams.

For crew_on_board why have [---] been on no incidents ?

For crew_on_shore why have [---] been on no incidents ?

on board attenders the most.
RB,ABJ, AM,DS,TR,RO,ABS.

on shore 

Who would be best to train next - experience

Who goes to the most call outs.

Who is not a coxswain already.

#Coxswains -training
1. Ronnie Britton - Coxswain 
2. Rennie Oliver - Deputy Coxswain 
3. Iain Gollan (Goz) - Deputy Coxswain 
4. Ally McLeod - Deputy Coxswain 
5. Andy Biddulph Snr - Deputy Coxswain & Safety Advisor

Training records - attendance, and outlines of what has been conducted.

Record trainging with pager code is training, details what was done.

# Geolocation on map

We have attached a html of the incidents plotted on a map.

INSERT: docs\imgs\map.html

# Social media

Craig Clancy - Crew & Social Media 
Callum MacKenzie Stevens

To make the most impact with the posts. 

Next steps could be to see how impact these posts are, and make changes to the posts to see if they are more effective. 

Here are some initial suggestions:

Of the social media posts there are only a handful of recordings it may be interesting for people to see the conditions of the loch and the boat launching and returning.

Take more videos.

media videos of the condiitions of the loch, people runing to the boat, the boat launching, the boat returning, the boat being cleaned, the boat being stored.
emergency services working together.

Recently there was apost about paddle boarding with advice.
If an incident falls within a area which often occurs it may be worth posting about it with advice slide.

Examples: 
- West highland way injuries
- Boat breakdowns
- Weather conditions


# Suggestions for data collection

To make it easier for crew we can have them input the What3Words for the incident location, or if they prefer the coordinates. To accomondate for this we have set up a tool that uses the What3Words API to convert the What3Words to coordinates. 

Should record time_of_shout_completion to counter time_of_shout, as may be different from time_boat_returned.

Try to specific a time for feats=['time_of_shout','time_boat_launched','time_boat_returned]

We recommend that the crew on board and on shore are recorded as initials, and as a comma separated list. If there are no crew on board or on shore, record as "None". This will make it easier to search for crew members and understand who was on board for each shout.

See data_recording.md

Question: What are the additionaly pager codes e.g. for 9992167 what does 2167 mean?

pager_code
222                                                                                                                     [ 4380]
333                    [ 2265, 369,  2428,  3077,  2673, 1753, 2585,  1846, 2563,  3072,  1151,  1456,  3439, 4906, 3630, 1717]
999    [2167,  0210,  1682, 1701, 4432,  1324, 2804,  1977,  3665,  2784,  1448,  1919,  1087,  1573,  2788,  2465, 2336, 3743]

Only two training shouts have been recorded. It would be good to have more training data to understand the training process. Particularly what is invovled and how often it is done and who needs training in certain areas.

Add the following to the top of the document that records the data of incidents:

Data recording for crew:

For where they record the data, place an initial outline at the top left of the document outlining the following:
- For location spell names correctly
- For times use the format (15:20)
- For location use What3Words
- For crew recording use initials
- For shout_detail_tags based on shout_details use the following tags:
  - Mechanical
  - Rescue
  - Medical
  - Environmental
  - Mishap
  - Assistance
  - FalseAlarm
  - Miscellaneous
  - Search
  - Transport

Weather:
Swell level (1-3)
Temperature (Celcius)
light level (Dark/Dusk/Daylight)
Wind direction (N/ E/ S/ W),(strong/weak)
Visability level (clear/foggy/misty)


# For report

To enhance the accuracy of recorded position data, we suggest that the crew record more precie position data by:
- using What3Words
- typing in google map coordinates


# Further lines of enquiry

Reading through the shout-details we see that LLRB also work with the following organisations:SAS,LLTNP,DMMS. How much interaction/cross organisational training and data sharing is there?

# Next steps:

feedback is welcome along with suggestions for further what to look into.
