## Data exploration

## Suggestions for data collection

To make it easier for crew we can have them input the What3Words for the incident location, or if they prefer the coordinates. To accomondate for this we have set up a tool that uses the What3Words API to convert the What3Words to coordinates. 

Should record time_of_shout_completion to counter time_of_shout

Try to specific a time for feats=['time_of_shout','time_boat_launched','time_boat_returned]

See data_recording.md
