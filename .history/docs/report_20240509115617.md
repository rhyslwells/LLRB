# Background and Data exploration

After ever incident the crew at Loch Lomond Rescue Boat (LLRB) record the details of the incident. In this report we:

- explore the data collected by LLRB from 2021 to 2023,
- provide insights into the incidents, crew attendance and training,
- discuss ways to improve social media posts,
- give suggestions on improving the data collection process,
- and suggest further lines of enquiry.


# Incident analysis

 incidents per year by pager codes( what do we see)

- ensure consistent y-scales for each year - 25

year 2021 Q3 low because thats when data startted getting recorded.

2022 and 2023 low Q1 + Q4 because less people on loch at time.

why the uptick in 999 in Q1 2023? 

Massive uptick Q2 2022 to 2023.

#  times 

shout to launch medians all 15mins

launch to return 222 are resolved on average faster that 333 and 999. 

INSERT boxplots

# shout tags

For each shout_detail item we provide shout_details_tags as a way to quickly understand the incident. Here are the tags and details they correspond to:

Tag categories:
- Mechanical
- Rescue
- Medical
- Environmental
- Mishap
- Assistance
- FalseAlarm
- Miscellaneous
- Search
- Transport

INSERT diagram of shout-tags stacked bar graph per month per year

can we forecast the type incidents most likely to occur in a given month.

Reading through the shout-details we see that LLRB also work with the following organisations:
- SAS
- LLTNP
- DMMS
We will enquire about cross organisational training and data sharing.

# Social media

Craig Clancy - Crew & Social Media 
Callum MacKenzie Stevens

To make the most impact with the posts. 

Next steps could be to see how impact these posts are, and make changes to the posts to see if they are more effective. 

Here are some initial suggestions:

Of the social media posts there are only a handful of recordings it may be interesting for people to see the conditions of the loch and the boat launching and returning.

Take more videos.

media videos of the condiitions of the loch, people runing to the boat, the boat launching, the boat returning, the boat being cleaned, the boat being stored.
emergency services working together.

Recently there was apost about paddle boarding with advice.
If an incident falls within a area which often occurs it may be worth posting about it with advice slide.

Examples: 
- West highland way injuries
- Boat breakdowns
- Weather conditions


# Crew Analysis 

Can we ensure training is being passed on to the next generation of crew members.

In order to reduce risk.

Table of initials and name of crew members.

INSERT diagrams.

For crew_on_board why have [---] been on no incidents ?

For crew_on_shore why have [---] been on no incidents ?

on board attenders the most.

Who would be best to train next - experience

Who goes to the most call outs.

Who is not a coxswain already.

Training records - attendance, and outlines of what has been conducted.

Record trainging with pager code is training, details what was done.


# Suggestions for data collection

To make it easier for crew we can have them input the What3Words for the incident location, or if they prefer the coordinates. To accomondate for this we have set up a tool that uses the What3Words API to convert the What3Words to coordinates. 

Should record time_of_shout_completion to counter time_of_shout, as may be different from time_boat_returned.

Try to specific a time for feats=['time_of_shout','time_boat_launched','time_boat_returned]

We recommend that the crew on board and on shore are recorded as initials, and as a comma separated list. If there are no crew on board or on shore, record as "None". This will make it easier to search for crew members and understand who was on board for each shout.

See data_recording.md

Question: What are the additionaly pager codes e.g. for 9992167 what does 2167 mean?

pager_code
222                                                                                                                     [ 4380]
333                    [ 2265, 369,  2428,  3077,  2673, 1753, 2585,  1846, 2563,  3072,  1151,  1456,  3439, 4906, 3630, 1717]
999    [2167,  0210,  1682, 1701, 4432,  1324, 2804,  1977,  3665,  2784,  1448,  1919,  1087,  1573,  2788,  2465, 2336, 3743]

Only two training shouts have been recorded. It would be good to have more training data to understand the training process. Particularly what is invovled and how often it is done and who needs training in certain areas.

Add the following to the top of the document that records the data of incidents:

Data recording for crew:

For where they record the data, place an initial outline at the top left of the document outlining the following:
- For location spell names correctly
- For times use the format (15:20)
- For location use What3Words
- For crew recording use initials
- For shout_detail_tags based on shout_details use the following tags:
  - Mechanical
  - Rescue
  - Medical
  - Environmental
  - Mishap
  - Assistance
  - FalseAlarm
  - Miscellaneous
  - Search
  - Transport

Weather:
Swell level (1-3)
Temperature (Celcius)
light level (Dark/Dusk/Daylight)
Wind direction (N/ E/ S/ W),(strong/weak)
Visability level (clear/foggy/misty)


# For report

To enhance the accuracy of recorded position data, we suggest that the crew record more precie position data by:
- using What3Words
- typing in google map coordinates
