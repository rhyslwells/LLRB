1) We started with combined.csv then in datatime.ipynb we standardise the dates and times to a common format and save as preprocessed_dates_time_data.csv.

2) In preprocessing.ipynb

we format crew,location and pager-code features. We add additional features to parse out these details.

Notes:

To make it easier for crew we can have them input the What3Words for the incident location, or if they prefer the coordinates. To accomondate for this we have set up a tool that uses the What3Words API to convert the What3Words to coordinates.
